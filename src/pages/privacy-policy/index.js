        &nbsp; &nbsp;- Our tool operates entirely on the client side, which

      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp; &nbsp;- Once the conversion is complete, the PNG file generated
        by our tool is made available for download directly to your device. We
        do not retain copies of these files.
